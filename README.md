# Remote Work & Mental Health üåçüß†

This project explores the impact of remote work on employee mental health using a synthetic dataset.

## üß© Problem Statement

With the rise of remote work, many organizations are unsure how flexible work arrangements affect employees' mental health. While remote work offers flexibility, it may also lead to feelings of isolation, burnout, or poor work-life balance. This project seeks to uncover patterns and provide data-driven insights that can help organizations support 
employee wellbeing in remote or hybrid work settings.

## üîç Objectives
- Analyze how remote work affects stress levels, sleep quality, and overall mental health.
- Identify patterns by age, job role, gender, and number of remote days per week.

## üìä Tool Used
- Microsoft Excel (Dashboarding, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting)

## Dataset
Source: {Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health) 

## üßπ Data Cleaning in Excel

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned using Excel to ensure data quality and accuracy:

- Removed duplicate rows
- Filled missing values 
- Formatted categorical variables for easy filtering and pivot analysis
- Removed outliers from age and stress score columns using logical filters
- Added a **COUNT helper column** to check for duplicates and verify data completeness

These steps helped create a clean and structured dataset for analysis and visualization.

## üß† Key Insights
- **76.08%** of participants reported experiencing mental health challenges.
- Only **48.94%** of respondents had access to mental health support services.
- The **average work-life balance rating** was **2.98** (on a 1‚Äì5 scale).
- **Remote workers** reported higher levels of **anxiety** compared to hybrid and onsite employees.
- Most employees who rated their satisfaction with remote work as **medium or high** reported overall positive experiences.
- **Marketing roles** had the **highest sleep quality**, averaging **2.03** on a 1‚Äì3 scale (lower = better).
- Those with a **medium stress level** had an average of **7.8 virtual meetings per week**, suggesting a possible link between frequent meetings and moderate stress.

## üí° Recommendations

- **Improve Access to Mental Health Services**: With over 75% reporting mental health challenges but only 48.94% having access to support, companies should expand mental health programs and promote awareness.

- **Reevaluate Remote Work Structures**: Since fully remote employees reported higher anxiety levels, organizations could consider promoting hybrid work options that blend flexibility with social interaction.

- **Limit Excessive Virtual Meetings**: Employees with medium stress levels averaged 7.8 virtual meetings per week. Encourage teams to adopt meeting-free blocks or async communication to reduce digital fatigue.

- **Tailor Support by Job Role**: Job-specific differences, such as high sleep quality in marketing roles, suggest the need for personalized wellness strategies per department.

- **Promote Work-Life Balance Initiatives**: With the average work-life balance score at 2.98, companies can introduce flexible hours, wellness days, or workload reviews to improve employee satisfaction.

## üßæ Conclusion

This project reveals the complex relationship between remote work and mental health. While remote work offers flexibility and convenience, it can also contribute to increased anxiety, especially when social interaction or support systems are lacking. 

The findings highlight the importance of tailored mental health support, balanced workloads, and mindful remote work practices. By using data to inform decisions, organizations can create healthier work environments that prioritize employee wellbeing ‚Äî whether remote, hybrid, or onsite.

## üßµ Expanded Analysis

This project has also been explored using SQL to uncover deeper trends and prepare data for further visualization in Tableau.
